This brief clean and visualization takes data from https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/budgets, specifically the profit and the budget of films and plots it with linear regression.

Conclusions found were:

For each dollar one spends on a movie, you can expect three dollars in profit. 
This is a very general and basic outcome from our data, as we are not considering other factors such as popularity, modern marketing campaigns, genre trends, and other
external factors that might cause a movie's profit to fail. This was solely an exercise and I may come back to this data at a later point to explore these factors.
